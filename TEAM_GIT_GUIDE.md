## 🔄 Workflow

### Daily Workflow

1. **Start of day:**
   ```bash
   cd /c/code/dayflow-hrms-2026
   git checkout your-branch
   git pull origin your-branch
   git pull origin decisioos  # Get latest changes
   ```

2. **During work:**
   - Make small, frequent commits
   - Push every 1-2 hours
   - Use meaningful commit messages

3. **End of day or feature complete:**
   - Push your final changes
   - Create a Pull Request to `decisioos`
   - Tag team lead for review

### Merging to Master

**ONLY the team lead** merges `decisioos` → `master` when:
- Feature is complete and tested
- Ready to show judges
- All team members have pushed their work

---

## 📝 Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:

```bash
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login bug
refactor: improve code structure
docs: update API documentation
test: add unit tests for auth
style: format code with prettier
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

1. **NEVER** work directly on `master` branch
2. **NEVER** push to `master` without review
3. **ALWAYS** pull before you push
4. **ALWAYS** commit every 1-2 hours max
5. **NEVER** commit sensitive data (.env files, API keys)
6. **ALWAYS** test your code before pushing
7. **ALWAYS** navigate to `/c/code/dayflow-hrms-2026` first!
